//! An implementation of the RAFT consensus protocol for replicating a log across a
//! cluster.
//!
//! The protocol logic is a pure, sequential step function over one unified per-member
//! state (see [`raft_step`]), hosted in a single dataflow tick — deliberately *not*
//! decomposed into separately-ticking election/replication components, because RAFT's
//! safety proofs interlock vote and log decisions through shared state (see the design
//! notes on [`raft`]).
//!
//! # Protocol mechanics
//!
//! Each member is a follower, a candidate, or the leader. A member whose election
//! timer fires becomes a candidate and requests votes, sending the index and term of
//! its last log entry; voters refuse candidates whose log is behind their own (RAFT
//! §5.4.1), which is what guarantees an elected leader holds every committed entry.
//!
//! The leader replicates by sending each follower `AppendEntries` messages carrying
//! new entries (empty for a pure heartbeat), the index and term of the entry
//! immediately preceding them, and the leader's commit index. The follower accepts
//! the entries iff its log contains a matching entry at that preceding position (the
//! log-matching property, RAFT §5.3), and advances its own commit index to
//! `min(leader_commit, index of last new entry)`. Acknowledgements report the highest
//! index known replicated on the follower; the leader advances its commit index once
//! a majority of members hold an entry of the current term, and steps down when any
//! reply carries a higher term than its own.

///   election timeout, so a live leader's heartbeats arrive between election
///   interrupts and suppress them.
/// * `net`: builds the fault model for the intra-cluster channel. Simulation tests
///   pass `|| TCP.fail_stop().bincode()`; deployments facing partitions pass
///   `|| TCP.lossy_delayed_forever().bincode()`, which RAFT is designed to

    /// The maximal version of the no-quiescence idea: *every* input for the entire
    /// run — election timer interrupts, client requests, and heartbeat pumps, for
    /// every member — is sent up front with **no intermediate quiescence at all**.
    /// The simulator's quiescing `collect` is used exactly once, at the end, to
    /// drain outputs; by then it cannot constrain how any inputs interleaved. The
    /// fuzzer therefore owns the complete schedule: which timer fires between which
    /// message deliveries, how batches form on each member's tick, everything.
    /// For deeper exploration, run it under coverage-guided fuzzing:
    /// `cargo sim -- fully_concurrent_run` (a found failure is saved as a
    /// minimized reproducer under `src/cluster/sim-failures/`, which plain
    /// `cargo test` then replays deterministically).
    ///
    /// The price of zero barriers is that nothing intermediate can be asserted — no
    /// "member X won term Y", and no liveness at all (a schedule where elections
    /// perpetually contend and nothing ever commits is legal). What remains is the
    /// protocol's core safety contract, checked at the end:
    ///
    /// 1. each member's committed stream has contiguous log indexes from 1 (each
    ///    position emitted exactly once, in order);
    /// 2. all members' committed histories are pairwise prefix-consistent (lagging
    ///    is fine, forking is not);
    /// 3. [`raft_step`]'s truncation guard never fires (surfaces as a panic /
    ///    SIGABRT if a committed entry is overwritten).
    ///
    /// Compared to the targeted test above, this explores a much larger schedule
    /// space with no phase structure biasing it toward the historical window — the
    /// stronger long-term net, while the targeted test remains the faster, more
    /// diagnostic one.
