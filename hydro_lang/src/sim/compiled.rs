//! Interfaces for compiled Hydro simulators and concrete simulation instances.
//!
//! # Quiescence and observation soundness
//!
//! The scheduler distinguishes two kinds of simulation work:
//! - **Deterministic work**: running the top-level async dataflows, which simply propagate
//!   whatever data is already in flight. This makes no `nondet!` decisions, so running it can
//!   never change which executions are explored.
//! - **Nondeterministic work**: running ticks and observations, whose behavior depends on
//!   decisions drawn from the bolero driver (batch boundaries, snapshot versions, message
//!   orderings). Each decision forks the space of possible executions.
//!
//! The simulation is **quiescent** when neither kind of work can make progress without new
//! external input. Test-side observations (the methods on [`SimReceiver`] /
//! [`SimClusterReceiver`]) interact with the scheduler while waiting, and the key soundness
//! question is: *when is it okay for an observation to let nondeterministic work run?*
//!
//! **Waiting for a message is always sound.** If the message eventually arrives, the work
//! that ran was necessary to produce it (schedules that run *extra* work are also valid
//! executions and are explored separately). If the simulation instead quiesces without
//! producing the message, the assertion fails and the instance ends, so nothing can observe
//! the overrun. This is why [`SimReceiver::next`], [`SimReceiver::collect_n`], and the
//! `assert_yields*` prefix checks are safe to use in the middle of a test.
//!
//! **Observing the *absence* of a message is dangerous.** Proving that "no more messages can
//! arrive" requires driving the simulation all the way to quiescence, running *all* pending
//! nondeterministic work. A later assertion may have needed to observe a state where that
//! work had not yet run — e.g., `assert_yields_only([1, 2])` followed by reading a counter
//! must be able to see the counter *before* the ticks that count `1` and `2` have fired.
//! Forcing quiescence at the first assertion would make some executions unobservable, and
//! extra messages produced by the forced work could surface at a *later* assertion,
//! misattributing the failure. Absence-observing APIs therefore proceed in phases:
//!
//! 1. **Settle** (see `SettlePauseGuard::poll_settle`): the scheduler runs only deterministic work, pausing
//!    just before nondeterministic work. If the simulation reaches quiescence this way, the
//!    end-of-stream check is *free* — no decision was forced, no execution was cut off — and
//!    the test simply continues.
//! 2. If nondeterministic work is pending, the check would overrun. What happens next depends
//!    on the API and engine:
//!    - The assertion APIs ([`SimReceiver::assert_no_more`], `assert_yields_only*`,
//!      `collect_n_only`) under [`CompiledSim::exhaustive`] **fork** the search on a bolero
//!      decision: one instance performs the check and then ends (via a discard panic, like
//!      `sim::continue_if!`), while sibling instances skip the check entirely and continue. The
//!      exhaustive driver enumerates the checking instance *first*, so a failing check is
//!      found before any instance runs past it — with a decision trace that leads exactly to
//!      the failing assertion. Since nothing after the check runs in the checking instance,
//!      the overrun it performs is unobservable, and the continuing instances never quiesce,
//!      so every downstream state remains reachable.
//!    - Otherwise (fuzz / RNG / replay engines, or the drain-everything APIs
//!      [`SimReceiver::try_next`], [`SimReceiver::collect`], and `collect_sorted` in every
//!      mode), the pending work runs and the instance is **tainted**
//!      (`QuiescenceState::tainted`). Reads of the now-quiescent state remain sound (they
//!      observe a fully-drained simulation that can no longer advance), so tests may drain
//!      multiple output ports at the end. But once new input is sent, the instance is
//!      **poisoned** (`QuiescenceState::poisoned`): any further receive panics (see
//!      `guard_not_poisoned`), because a failure observed after the forced overrun could
//!      have been caused by it and attributed to the wrong assertion.
//!
//! NOTE: This module runs inside bolero's `catch_unwind` scope, which silently
//! swallows panics. Internal invariant checks should use `abort_assert!`
//! rather than `panic!`/`assert!`.
//!
//! TODO(mingwei): Panics inside the tick DFIR (generated code in the dylib) are
//! also caught by bolero's `catch_unwind`. Consider a mechanism to detect and
//! propagate those as well.

/// Like `assert!`, but calls `std::process::abort()` instead of `panic!()`.
/// Use for internal invariants that must not be silently caught by bolero.
