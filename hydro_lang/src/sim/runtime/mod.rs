//! The hook objects that give the simulator scheduler control over unsafe
//! (nondeterministic) operators. Generated simulation code constructs one hook per
//! unsafe operator instance and registers it in the location-keyed maps returned to the
//! host ([`Hooks`], [`ObservationHooks`], [`InlineHooks`], and the scripted variants);
//! the scheduler in `sim::compiled` then drives every decision through the type-erased
//! traits defined here.
//!
//! This module holds the shared foundation: the location key ([`SimLocation`]), the hook
//! traits ([`RuntimeHook`] and its two refinements [`TickInputHook`] and
//! [`ObservationHook`], plus the in-tick [`InlineHook`]), and the error/log rendering
//! helpers. The hook kinds live in submodules, re-exported here so generated code can
//! refer to everything as `sim::runtime::X`:
//!
//! - `tick_input`: hooks that buffer input for a tick and decide what to release into
//!   each execution (batches, snapshots).
//! - `observation`: top-level hooks that are their own scheduling unit (e.g.
//!   `assume_ordering` or a hooked `fold` on a non-tick stream).
//! - `inline`: hooks resolved *during* a tick's execution (in-tick ordering).
//! - `scripted`: the script layer — decision traits, the [`Scripted`] /
//!   [`ScriptedInline`] shells that bind hooks to test-side handles, and the registry
//!   types.
